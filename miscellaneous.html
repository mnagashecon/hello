	<h2>Some R codes</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="files/desc_fun.R">R code to calculate summary statistics (N, mean, sd) and output a LaTeX tabular.</a><br>
		I hate it when people say, use package A and code this, use package B, etc. when they don't actually write the package. 
		You spend days and nights to figure out how to use the functions in it. In several years the package will be abandoned and your results will be irreproducible. 
		Better not to rely too much on others' works. Particularly when I have some routine works that I wanna do in my favourite way.<br>
		I don't claim any copyright. You can copy and paste it whenever you want. On the other hand, I don't care if you don't like the functions. 
		I am writing this for me myself, not for you.
